This project folder features my personal portfolio website containing
my past work experiences, projects and contact information. 

To access it, check out the "Web1" folder and right click any of the html 
files in a Visual Studio code environment. Preferably right click the 
"home.html" file since that's the home page although it's accessible from 
all other pages on the website. After right clicking, you'll see the option 
to "Open with Live Server". Click this and it will open up my personal website
in your browser.
